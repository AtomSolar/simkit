Welcome to Circus's documentation!
==================================
Circus ia s framework for simulating mathematical models that decouples the
models from the simulation implementation. It takes care of boilerplate routines
such as loading data from various sources into a key store that can be used from
any calculation, determining the correct order of calculations, stepping through
dynamic simulations and generating output reports and visualizations, so that
you can focus on developing models and don't have to worry about how to add new
models or how to integrate changes.
